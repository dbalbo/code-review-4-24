does nothing right now

first-code-review
this is full of nothing but minor explanations
I have explained in as much detail as possible my current limitations. 

I do know how to deploy to heroku but have decided not to put anyting that doesnt work on it
( was this a bad decision?)

Things I understand to a point where I can do it with zero issues:
git--creating repositories, adding, commiting--all the things that I need to do to upkeep my repos. 
I have experieced getting"caught up" with all my pairs thus far in terms of NOT doing it as often as we should. 
I know that I need to be more mindful of thi sand do it instead of just taling about doing it.
Heroku-- I get this deployment and how its done. Since I had nothing to really deploy, I chose not to do this.

Things Im fuzzy about:
the "title" reference in the index files. Does it always have to be "title" or can it be something else? 
I can get it to work, but I need to solidify this a bit more.
The layout.erb page--I understand that 
"everything goes through this first" and that the yeild gets the erb and the html to "talk" to each other (I think) but I need more info about this to cement it in( In plain english)
KNowing a zillion ways that I COULD do something leaves someone like me with
the Paradox of Choice. Too many choices can be crippling to me.
If there ARE a billion ways to do something, 
I will simultaneously think about ALL of them, and then I shut down.
Logically, a good solution would be to maybe pick a couple and just go with those,
but then it limits my capabilities in the future and also while working in pairs
( I can explain this further if needed) 
Any sage-like advice on how to overcome this will be so much appreciated.
